This is a 3-gram language model, based on a vocabulary of 1000 words,
  which begins ""essais."", ""essay,"", ""inappropriate,""...
This is an OPEN-vocabulary model (type 1)
  (OOVs were mapped to UNK, which is treated as any other vocabulary word)
Good-Turing discounting was applied.
1-gram frequency of frequency : 559 
2-gram frequency of frequency : 2538 290 91 35 22 9 10 
3-gram frequency of frequency : 3825 127 15 8 4 2 1 
1-gram discounting ratios : 0.00 
2-gram discounting ratios : 0.21 0.46 0.50 0.78 0.48

This file is in the ARPA-standard format introduced by Doug Paul.

p(wd3|wd1,wd2)= if(trigram exists)           p_3(wd1,wd2,wd3)
                else if(bigram w1,w2 exists) bo_wt_2(w1,w2)*p(wd3|wd2)
                else                         p(wd3|w2)

            else              bo_wt_1(wd1)*p_1(wd2)

All probs and back-off weights (bo_wt) are given in log10 form.
